In January 2026, we attended **SPIE Photonics West 2026**, one of the world’s largest international conferences in optics and photonics, where we clearly felt the rapidly growing interest in **Co-Packaged Optics (CPO)**.

At SPIE Photonics West 2026, **Ph.D. student Taewon Jin** delivered an oral presentation titled *“A Scalable Silicon Nitride Photonic Platform on Glass for High Density Optical RDL Integration in Panel-Level Packaging,”* introducing a scalable **SiN-on-Glass** photonic platform for high-density optical redistribution layers (RDL), along with key design/characterization results and system-level implications.

We also explored a wide range of academic and industry exhibits, which provided a valuable snapshot of current trends in photonics and the evolving packaging ecosystem.

After the conference, we visited **Google** and **Ayar Labs** in Silicon Valley.  
It was a meaningful opportunity to see up close how photonics research connects to real industrial requirements and scales toward system integration.
