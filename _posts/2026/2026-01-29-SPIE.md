## Highlight 
- At SPIE Photonics West 2026, we captured the strong global momentum around Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) and advanced photonic packaging.
- We presented a scalable SiN-on-Glass photonic platform for high-density optical RDL, highlighting system-level relevance.
- Visits to Stanford, NVIDIA, Google, and Ayar Labs provided firsthand insight into the translation of photonics research into industry and systems.

In January 2026, we attended **SPIE Photonics West 2026**, one of the world’s largest international conferences in optics and photonics, where we clearly felt the rapidly growing interest in **Co-Packaged Optics (CPO)**.

At SPIE Photonics West 2026, **Ph.D. student Taewon Jin** delivered an oral presentation titled *“A Scalable Silicon Nitride Photonic Platform on Glass for High Density Optical RDL Integration in Panel-Level Packaging,”* introducing a scalable **SiN-on-Glass** photonic platform for high-density optical redistribution layers (RDL), along with key design/characterization results and system-level implications.

We also explored a wide range of academic and industry exhibits, which provided a valuable snapshot of current trends in photonics and the evolving packaging ecosystem.

After the conference, we visited Stanford Univ., Nvidia, Google and Ayar Labs in Silicon Valley.  
It was a meaningful opportunity to see up close how photonics research connects to real industrial requirements and scales toward system integration.
