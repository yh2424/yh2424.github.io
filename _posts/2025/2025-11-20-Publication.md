## Abstract
We present silicon nitride photonics on glass (SING), demonstrated at the wafer-level, establishing its feasibility for high-density optical redistribution layers (RDLs) in panel-level packaging. Demonstrated passive components support 106 Gbps transmission, enabling scalable wafer-level optical interconnects with grating couplers, ring resonators, MMI couplers, MZIs, and stitched waveguides. With a compact 100 µm bend radius, SING enables a 10× higher density than LDW or IOX glass platforms, while remaining compatible with large-panel processing. This positions SING as a promising and scalable solution for next-generation optical RDLs.
