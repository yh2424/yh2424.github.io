At PC 2025, Ph.D. student Taewon Jin and master’s students Kyungjin Jo, Seokhyeon Yoon, Heeyun Jeong, and Jonggeon Lee gave an oral presentation. And master’s students Seokyoung Shin, Seonghyeok Bae and Jihyun Lee, as well as undergraduate students Seungwoo Park, Baehun Jo, Woojae Kim and Lina Kim presented posters. The conference served as a valuable platform to present our latest research in Co-Packaged Optics (CPO), silicon photonics, and advanced photonic packaging, while engaging in discussions on next-generation optical I/O and high-performance interconnect architectures. In addition, the active technical exchanges throughout the event provided timely perspectives on the fast-changing optical packaging landscape and emerging directions for CPO-driven system integration.
