At PC 2025, Ph.D. student Taewon Jin and master’s students Kyungjin Jo, Seokhyeon Yoon, Huiyun Jeong, and Jonggeon Lee gave an oral presentation. The conference served as a valuable platform to present our latest research in Co-Packaged Optics (CPO), silicon photonics, and advanced photonic packaging, while engaging in discussions on next-generation optical I/O and high-performance interconnect architectures. In addition, the active technical exchanges throughout the event provided timely perspectives on the fast-changing optical packaging landscape and emerging directions for CPO-driven system integration.
