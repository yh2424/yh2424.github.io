At PC 2025, Ph.D. student Taewon Jin, master’s students Kyungjin Jo, Seokhyeon Yoon, Huiyun Jeong, and Jonggeon Lee delivered an oral presentation. The conference provided a meaningful venue to share our recent research achievements in Co-Packaged Optics (CPO), silicon photonics, and advanced photonic packaging technologies, along with discussions on next-generation optical I/O and high-performance interconnect architectures. Through active technical exchange, the event offered valuable insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of optical packaging and the future directions of CPO-centric system integration.
