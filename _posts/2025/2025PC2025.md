At PC 2025, master’s students Seokyoung Shin, Seonghyeok Bae and Jihyun Lee, as well as undergraduate students Seungwoo Park, Baehun Jo, Woojae Kim and Lina Kim presented posters. This conference served as a significant platform for disseminating our latest findings in Co-Packaged Optics (CPO), silicon photonics and advanced photonic packaging technologies. It facilitated critical discussions on future optical I/O and high-performance interconnect architectures. Through active technical exchange, we gained valuable insights into the dynamic field of optical packaging and the strategic direction of CPO-based system integration.
