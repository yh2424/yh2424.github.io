## Abstract
We propose a measurement system that enables the rapid measurement of insertion loss and polarization-dependent loss using a parallel test setup with a fiber array, and the calibration procedure to be used within this system. By applying rough scan methods, we have developed a calibration algorithm that efficiently finds the accurately optimized state of polarization in minimal time. Through conducting on-wafer spectral optical power measurements, we compared conventional applications and our proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that our method enables the almost simultaneous measurement of the spectral responses of multiple optical components. Moreover, the method enables to measure these responses with a well-defined input state of polarization (SOP) applied to each path individually.  This novel approach holds promise for enhancing accuracy and cost-effectiveness in insertion loss and polarization-dependent loss measurements.

## 연구내용
본 연구에서는 IL과 PDL을 신속하게 측정할 수 있게 하기 위하여 병렬 테스트 셋업을 제안하고 셋업을 활용할 수 있는 알고리즘을 제안하여 종전의 측정 방식보다 충분히 빠르고 정확함을 보임.

## 기대효과
Fiber array를 통해 다수의 샘플을 동시에 align하여 align에 필요한 시간을 크게 줄이고 interference에 의한 오차를 줄일 수 있음이 기대됨.
