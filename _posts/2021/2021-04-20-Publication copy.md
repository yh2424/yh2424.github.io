## Abstract
The realization of a silicon optical phase shifter marked a cornerstone for the development of silicon photonics, and it is expected that optical interconnects based on the technology relax the explosive datacom growth in data centers. High-performance silicon optical modulators and switches, integrated into a chip, play a very important role in optical transceivers, encoding electrical signals onto the light at high speed and routing the optical signals, respectively. The development of the devices is continuously required to meet the ever-increasing data traffic at higher performance and lower cost. Therefore, heterogeneous integration is one of the highly promising approaches, expected to enable high modulation efficiency, low loss, low power consumption, small device footprint, etc. Therefore, we review heterogeneously integrated optical modulators and switches for the next-generation silicon photonic platform.
